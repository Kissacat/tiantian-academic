abstract: With the advance in automatic speech recognition, voice user interface
  has gained popularity recently. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, VUI is
  increasingly preferred in online communication due to its non-contact.
  Additionally, various ambient noise impedes the public applications of voice
  user interfaces due to the requirement of audio-only speech recognition
  methods for a high signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we present Wavoice,
  the first noise-resistant multi-modal speech recognition system that fuses two
  distinct voice sensing modalities, i.e., millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals and
  audio signals from a microphone, together. One key contribution is that we
  model the inherent correlation between mmWave and audio signals. Based on it,
  Wavoice facilitates the real-time noise-resistant voice activity detection and
  user targeting from multiple speakers. Furthermore, we elaborate on two novel
  modules into the neural attention mechanism for multi-modal signals fusion,
  and result in accurate speech recognition. Extensive experiments verify
  Wavoice's effectiveness under various conditions with the character
  recognition error rate below 1% in a range of 7 meters. Wavoice outperforms
  existing audio-only speech recognition methods with lower character error rate
  and word error rate. The evaluation in complex scenes validates the robustness
  of Wavoice.
