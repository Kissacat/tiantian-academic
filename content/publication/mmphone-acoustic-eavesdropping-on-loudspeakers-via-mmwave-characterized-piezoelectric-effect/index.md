abstract: >-
  More and more people turn to online voice communication with
  loudspeaker-equipped devices due to its convenience. To prevent speech
  leakage, soundproof rooms are often adopted. This paper presents mmPhone, a
  novel acoustic

  eavesdropping system that recovers loudspeaker speech protected

  by soundproof environments. The key idea is that properties

  of piezoelectric films in mmWave band can change with sound

  pressure due to the piezoelectric effect. If the property changes

  are acquired by an adversary (i.e., characterizing the piezoelectric

  effect with mmWaves), speech leakage can happen. More importantly, the piezoelectric film can work without a power supply. Base on this, we proposed a methodology using mmWaves to

  sense the film and decoding the speech from mmWaves, which

  turns the film into a passive “microphone”. To recover intelligible

  speech, we further develop an enhancement scheme based on

  a denoising neural network, multi-channel augmentation, and

  speech synthesis, to compensate for the propagation and penetration loss of mmWaves. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate mmPhone and conduct digit recognition with over 93%

  accuracy. The results indicate mmPhone can recover high-quality

  and intelligible speech from a distance over 5m and is resilient to

  incident angles of sound waves (within 55 degrees) and different

  types of loudspeakers.
